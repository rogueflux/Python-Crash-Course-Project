# Google Python Crash Course Project
Problem Statement:
Make a report on which users are logged into the Server Machine along with the time. Process a list of event objects using their attributes to generate a report that lists all users currently logged in

Planning:
1. Make a Dictionary which stores different attributes as keys along with their values
2. Make a Function to get the Event Date which gets called into another function which makes the dictionary
3. Make a Separate Function for printing said Dictionary Attributes as it will be easier to modify the report by only changing this function
